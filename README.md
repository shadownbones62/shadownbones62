## Hey there, fellow developer! :-)

- I'm currently learning Python and C++ to acquire the basics and become a well-rounded professional.
- My interests: Singing, playing guitar, using as much Open Source Software as possible.
- Fun fact: My first degree is Biotech Engineering and I work for a company that runs Clinical Trials. If you have any doubts related to this industry or any biological concept, do let me know. ;)
